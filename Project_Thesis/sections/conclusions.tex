In conclusion, IllustrisTNG is a powerful tool for studying galaxy formation and evolution. On most of the properties studied here, it shows excellent agreement to observations.

In future works, I would like to study entire snapshots instead of the premade data catalogues. In particular, it would be interesting to look at the velocity profiles of galaxies in more detail.
