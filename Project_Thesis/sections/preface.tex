I would firstly like to thank my supervisor Santiago Ismael Ferrero for being incredibly supportive and helpful throughout this project. Despite a semester quite out of the ordinary, geographical challenges as well as a global pandemic have not stopped Ismael from always being available and ready to answer my questions and inspire me to do my best.

I would also like to thank my friends and family for supporting me with everything from reading through my text, helping me when I have been stuck or just listening on the phone when it was needed. In a time when one can easily feel isolated I have found that help comes to those that dare ask for it. Lastly I would specifically like to thank my swimming group and especially Marthe, I am not sure I could have stayed sane through this semester without you.
