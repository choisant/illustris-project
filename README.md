# Illustris project
This is my first trial at making a functioning repository for working with the [Illustris](tng-project.org) data. 


## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the needed python packages:

```bash
pip install numpy
```
The python packages used in this project are:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- h5py
- six

You also need the Jupyter Notebook application
```bash
pip install notebook
```
## Usage

To run the code, first clone the entire repository from github to your local computer.
The python files can then be run directly from the terminal. 

```powershell
cd "..."/illustris-project/src
./myfile.py
```

The jupyter notebooks can be run from the browser by starting the Jupyter Notebook application from the terminal:

```
cd "..."/illustris-project
jupyter notebook
```
NOTE: the python files and the jupyter notebook files use slightly different paths to navigate through the directories. Any problems that arise might have to do with this, so please be aware of what is your working directory while running the code.
